# Library-Management
Starter Java/Spring Boot/JDBC/JPA project

### First Library-management working prototype
This project is a starter project that I used to build up and brush up my Java skills.
It is Library management app where you can add, update and delete books in sort of "library database" (h2 database for now).

### In this project you can find examples of using:
- JPA
- OOP concepts
- connecting to H2 database
- CRUD methods implementation
- Vaadin framework

### Process of building this and future upgrades

I will soon post update on thought process and development process of this simple app.

#### Disclaimer
Everything you see here is for educational purposes only and if you have any suggestion on how I can upgrade my Java skills based on this work feel free to contact me.
I am aware that some of practices used in here are perhaps not best.
